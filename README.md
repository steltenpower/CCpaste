Maybe more people properly mention licences, when it is less 'hassle'.
On an OS, webbrowser or JavaScript library level I'm wondering how far this idea can be taken: Copy-Paste that (partially) understands copyright.

It would help adding a license to what you're creating, based on (licenses of) content you're using.

Of course this complex subject can't be fixed/replaced by a piece of software, but certainly 'significantly helped' should be possible if a few often used licenses are supported


Maybe https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_REL , https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Web_Integration , https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/XMP_Implementations can help a bit

This was mentioned to the top developer at CreativeCommons, but without reply :-(

Btw: There are now 'emoji' for the different Creative Commons licences: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Unicode_symbols

Inkscape is so much better with working grid detection, and clipart which tells you the license when you import them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRbA5mGChCU
