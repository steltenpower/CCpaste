Maybe more people properly mention licences, when it is less 'hassle'.
On an OS, webbrowser or JavaScript library level I'm wondering how far this idea can be taken: Copy-Paste that (partially) understands copyright.

It would help adding a license to what you're creating, based on (licenses of, not necessarily limited to Creative Commons) content you're using.

Of course this complex subject can't be fixed/replaced by a piece of software, but certainly 'significantly helped' should be possible if a few often used licenses are supported


Maybe https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_REL , https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Web_Integration , https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/XMP_Implementations can help a bit

Btw: There are now 'emoji' for the different Creative Commons licences: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Unicode_symbols

Inkscape is so much better with working grid detection, and clipart which tells you the license when you import them: https://youtu.be/GRbA5mGChCU?t=265

Explaining me why this idea makes no sense at ALL, is also helpful

Drag your Image Search results in

I Googled quite a bit but haven't yet found an example that allows to drag an image from one browser window to another :-( (not the same, but on Mac you can drag an image from Safari into Powerpoint)

https://help.libreoffice.org/6.1/he/text/swriter/classificationbar.html (blocks content with incompatible restrictions to be dragged in)

Also look at IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)
