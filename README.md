# copyPasteThatUnderstandsCopyright
Maybe more people properly mention licences, when it is less hassle.
On an OS, webbrowser or JavaScript library level I'm wondering how far this idea can be taken

It would also detect when licences (of content you're using and of that you're creating) are incompatible

Of course this complex subject can't be fixed/replaced by a piece of software, but certainly 'significantly helped' should be possible.

Maybe https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_REL , https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Web_Integration , https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/XMP_Implementations can help a bit
